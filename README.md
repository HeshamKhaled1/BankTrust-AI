# BankTrust AI

## Project Overview

BankTrust AI is a fraud detection system designed to evaluate the credibility of new clients by cross-referencing their data with two partner banks. The system aims to assess whether a client is trustworthy before approving loan requests, using a machine learning model to predict the client’s suitability based on historical data.

## Key Features
- **Client Registration**: A website allows clients to register by providing personal details such as name, national ID, mother’s name, and email.
- **Data Cross-Checking**: The system cross-references the client's data with records from two partner banks using a centralized data warehouse.
- **Machine Learning Classification**: A machine learning algorithm analyzes the client's loan and repayment history to assess their credibility.
- **Database Update**: Clients deemed credible are flagged in the bank’s database, allowing them to proceed with loan transactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure SQL Database**: For structured storage of client and loan information.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For data warehousing and high-performance querying of client information across the three banks.
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: For automating data extraction and transformation pipelines.
- **Azure Databricks**: Used for both data transformation (CSV to database conversion) and machine learning model training and evaluation.
- **Flask**: For developing the client registration website.
- **Power BI**: For generating reports and visualizations on customer credibility and loan trends.

## System Workflow
1. **Client Registration**: Clients enter their details via the registration website.
2. **Data Verification**: The system searches the data warehouse for the client's records in partner banks.
3. **Machine Learning Evaluation**: The machine learning model evaluates the client’s loan history and repayment behavior.
4. **Decision Making**: The system flags credible clients in the database, allowing them to proceed with loan transactions.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Azure account with access to services such as SQL Database, Synapse Analytics, Data Factory, and Databricks.
- Python 3.9 or higher (for the Flask app).
- Power BI for report generation.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/BankTrust-AI.git
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure your Azure services and update connection strings for Azure SQL Database, Synapse Analytics, Data Factory, and Databricks in the `.env` file.
5. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the client registration website.

### Power BI Reports
- Power BI reports can be generated by connecting to the Azure Synapse Analytics data warehouse.
